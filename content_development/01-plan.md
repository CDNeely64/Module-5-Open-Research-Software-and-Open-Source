## Module 5: Initiate and plan

   1. Define the target groups
   
   - Computational researchers
   - Graduate students
   - Data scientists
   - Any other researcher who uses analytical code/software
   
   
   2. Refine the learning objectives and outcomes
   
   - The researcher will be able to define the characteristics of open source research software, and the           ethical, legal, economic and research impact arguments for and against it.
   - Based on community standards, researchers will be able to describe the quality requirements of sharing        and re-using open code.
   - The researcher will be able to use a range of research tools that utilise open source software.
   - Individual researchers will be able to transform code designed for their personal use into code that is        accessible and re-usable by others.
