## Module 5: Initiate and plan

   1. Define the target groups
   
   - Computational researchers
   - Graduate students
   - Data scientists
   - Any other researcher who uses analytical code/software
   
   
   2. Refine the learning objectives and outcomes
   
   - Learners will be able to define the characteristics of open source research software, and the ethical, legal, economic and research impact arguments for and against it.
   - Based on community standards, learners will be able to describe the quality requirements of sharing and re-using open code.
   - Learners will be able to use a range of research tools that utilise open source software.
   - Learners will be able to transform code designed for their personal use into code that is accessible and re-usable by others.
   
   
   3. Design the course outline
      1. What is Open Source software and why do we need it? (Intro, background, examples)
      2. Why should I share my code, and how do I go about it? (Code as a research output, github, etc)
      3. What makes good software, how can I make it easy for others to re-use? (testing, comments, "good-enough practices in software development".
      4. Where do I go from here? (Introduction to the Open Source community, further resources for learning, etc.)
      
   4. Design the project plan and timeline
   
   
   5. Identify promotion channels
