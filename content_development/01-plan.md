## Module 5: Initiate and plan

   1. Define the target groups
   
   - Computational researchers
   - Graduate students
   - Data scientists
   - Any other researcher who uses analytical code/software
   
   
   2. Refine the learning objectives and outcomes
   
   - The researcher will be able to define the characteristics of open source research software, and the ethical, legal, economic and research impact arguments for and against it.
   - Based on community standards, researchers will be able to describe the quality requirements of sharing and re-using open code.
   - The researcher will be able to use a range of research tools that utilise open source software.
   - Individual researchers will be able to transform code designed for their personal use into code that is accessible and re-usable by others.
   
   
   3. Design the course outline
      1. Principles of Open Source Software.
      1. What open, collaborative platforms, with version control, exist.
      1. How to use GitHub combined with the Zenodo plug-in for code archiving.
      1. How to document and publish code.
      1. Open Source licensing.
      1. Tools for better open research
      1. Community codes, governance, and contributions.
      1. How to access and start working on general computing platforms
      1. Software citation.
      1. Differences in setting up accounts/storage/computing on different platforms.
      1. Comparison in terms of collaboration and openness with clusters/in-house servers.
