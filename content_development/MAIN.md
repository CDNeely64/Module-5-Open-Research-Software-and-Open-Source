## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

Welcome to Module 5 of the Open Science MOOC: Open Research Software and Open Source. This module has been developed [in the open](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-5-Open-Research-Software-and-Open-Source) through collaboration by an international team of [Open Source afficianados](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-5-Open-Research-Software-and-Open-Source#development-team).

Software and technology underpin modern science, which is now almost inevitably computational to varying degrees. There is an ever-increasing demand for more sophisticated Open Source Software, matched by an increasing willingness for researchers to openly collaborate on new tools. 

These developments come with a specific ethical, legal and economic challenges that impact upon research workflows. This Module will introduce the necessary tools required for transforming software into something that can be openly accessed and re-used by others.

Specific learning outcomes for this Module:

* You will be able to define the characteristics of open source research software, and the ethical, legal, economic and research impact arguments for and against it.
* Based on community standards, you will be able to describe the quality requirements of sharing and re-using open code.
* You will be able to use a range of research tools that utilise open source software.
* You will be able to transform code designed for their personal use into code that is accessible and re-usable by others.
* Software developers will be able to make their software citable, and software users will know how to cite the software they use.


## What is Open Source Software <a name="What_OSS"></a>

Open Source Software (OSS) is computer software in which the source code is available under a specific license that enables other users to access, modify, and redistribute that code for any purpose.

The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/), one of the pioneers of OSS, offers the following [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition#Definition):

 - *Free Redistribution*: The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.

- *Source Code*: The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost preferably, downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.

- *Derived Works*: The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.
Integrity of The Author's Source Code The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.

- *No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups*: The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

- *No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor*: The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.

- *Distribution of License*: The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.

- *License Must Not Be Specific to a Product*: The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.

- *License Must Not Restrict Other Software*: The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.

- *License Must Be Technology-Neutral*: No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.

Now, this all might be a little complex to remember. However, it can be summarised as making software as re-usable as possible for future works, while also being freely available. This principle of re-use is what separates OSS from 'Free Software'.


## Principles of Open Source Software <a name="Principles"></a>


## The Open Source community and its governance <a name="OS_Community"></a>


## Existing platforms and tools for Open Source Software <a name="Platforms"></a>


## Making good software for re-use <a name="Reuse"></a>


## Open Source licensing <a name="Licensing"></a>


## Software citation <a name="Citation"></a>


## Using GitHub and Zenodo <a name="GitHub_Zenodo"></a>


## Collaborating and contributing through Open Source <a name="Collaborating"></a>

Often, OSS is developed in a public, collaborative manner between multiple contributors. The purpose of this is to enhance the diversity and scope of a project and its design, in order to become more beneficial and sustainable.
